# Creating a Student Grades Database
---
### Overview:
In this project, I will practice using Python lists, functions, and dictionaries to create a database that contains student names, information about problem sets that were given to them, and their grades for each problem.

In the first part of this project, I will work with a simplified version of the database that is constructed using lists. Next, I will create a more advanced, faster, and efficient version of the database that uses dictionaries to store its entries. Finally, I will define some advanced Python functions that compute the weighted average for each student in the database.

### Data Engineering Tools:
- Python
- Advanced Python Functions
